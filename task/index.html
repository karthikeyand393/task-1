                Weiss
                for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R.
                Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show premiered on HBO in the United States on April

            </p>
            <p>Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and
                follows several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron
                Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families
                either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it. The second major
                arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos
                and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne. The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order
                defending the realm against threats from beyond the Seven Kingdoms' northern border</p>

                House Stark[1] of Winterfell is a Great House of Westeros and the royal house of the Kingdom of the
                North. They rule over the vast region known as the North. It is one of the oldest lines of Westerosi
                nobility by far, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight thousand years. Before Aegon's
                Conquest, as well as during the War of the Five Kings and early on in the Last War, the leaders of House
                Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North.
